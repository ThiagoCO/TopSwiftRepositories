These indicators are usually segmented/stacked LEDs, with several colors to indicate thresholds. This control replicates that look, using Quartz drawing primitives, and auto-adjusts to horizontal or vertical orientation. Additionally, the colors, number of bars, peak hold, and other items are easily customized. Intended uses include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why it should be included to `awesome-ios` (mandatory)\r\nIt's simple and people like to visually show numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.
